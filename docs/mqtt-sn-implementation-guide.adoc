== Introduction ==
This non-normative document providers implementers guidance on the usage of the MQTT-SN specification(s).
The MQTT-SN specification provides a basis for interoperability between implementations of both MQTT-SN and MQTT system components.
Implementers will be making important decisions regarding networking, authentication mechanisms, deployment architectures, session
state and application taxonomies. These decisions will be guided by each unique set of deployment/infrastructure circumstances
and therefore there is not one single "correct" way of using the specification. This should be taken into consideration when
deploying a specified artefact. Further, not all functional areas of the normative behaviour need be implemented in order to be
considered compliant to the specification. For example, a deployment may be limited by a transport medium which does not support
broadcast capability. This will restrict the ability to provide discovery behaviour defined in the specification but in no way
limits other aspects of the functionality. Implementers should be clear when publishing works where their artefacts diverge
functionally or omit aspects of the specification so as to ease interoperability tasks.

=== Recommended Knowledge ===
The reader is assumed to be very familiar with:

.MQTT Family of specifications
* MQTT 3.1
* MQTT 3.1.1
* MQTT 5.0
* MQTT-SN 1.2
* MQTT-SN 2.0

.Recommended reading
* SASL (RFC 222 & RFC 442)

== MQTT-SN Architectures ==
The IoT has brought about the advent of the mass deployment of "wireless sensor" / "sensor fusion" devices.
These devices are more often-than-not simple, low cost, low powered (battery), connecting using unreliable network
connections and deployed in high volume. They are typically (but not limited to) concerned with capturing; measurements,
environmental conditions, process control and fault detection. Further, as systems become ever more complex and distributed
the role of gateways, forwarders and inter-connected clients is all the more important as networking modalities are traversed
in order for data to find its way back to the enterprise.

(NB: Ensure this para does not limit use in any way, think intra system BUS etc.)

=== Examples ===
(SLJ - EoW 18th Nov)

== Client Connection (CONNECT / CONNACK) ==
== Authentication ==

The authentication section doesn't say anything about the use of the AUTH packet

== Sessions ==
=== On the Client ===
=== On the Gateway ===

== Topics (REGISTER / REGACK) ==
== Subscription (SUBSCRIBE / SUBACK) ==

=== Topic Filter Matching ===
(SLJ - EoW 18th Nov)

=== Subscription Storage Examples At Scale ===
The topic/subscription tree is the beating heart of any MQTT Broker / Gateway or indeed Client implementation. Having tried a few data structures out over the years, the one noted to be the most time and memory efficient was a token based Trie implementation. I have open-sourced a version which demonstrates the technique of storing topics in a normalized way, allowing fast hash based lookups. The time complexity is a function of the depth of the Tries tree.
