## OASIS TC Open Repository: mqtt-sn-sample-resources

This GitHub public repository [mqtt-sn-sample-resources](https://github.com/oasis-open/mqtt-sn-sample-resources) was created at the request of the [OASIS MQTT TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/mqtt/) and, in particular, the [MQTT SN subcommittee](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=mqtt-sn) as an [OASIS TC Open Repository](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/) to support development of open source resources related to Technical Committee work.

While this TC Open Repository remains associated with the sponsor TC, its development priorities, leadership, intellectual property terms, participation rules, and other matters of governance are separate and distinct from the OASIS TC Process and related policies.

All contributions made to this TC Open Repository are subject to open source license terms expressed in [Apache License v 2.0](https://www.oasis-open.org/sites/www.oasis-open.org/files/Apache-LICENSE-2.0.txt). That license was selected as the declared [Applicable License](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses) when the TC voted to create this Open Repository.

As documented in [Public Participation Invited](href="https://github.com/oasis-open/mqtt-sn-sample-resources/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#public-participation-invited), contributions to this TC Open Repository are invited from all parties, whether affiliated with OASIS or not. Participants must have a GitHub account, but no fees or OASIS membership obligations are required.  Participation is expected to be consistent with the [OASIS TC Open Repository Guidelines and Procedures](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-repositories), the open source [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) designated for this particular repository, and the requirement for an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](href="https://cla-assistant.io/oasis-open/mqtt-sn-sample-resources") that governs intellectual property.

## Statement of Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to help grow the understanding the specifications and facilitate other implementation efforts by providing sample and example implementations of, and educational materials about, the MQTT-SN standards.

Note: this repository is not for the discussion or raising of issues on the specifications and standards themselves - the MQTT TC mailing list should be used or, for non-TC members, the comment mailing list as described at https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/comments/index.php?wg_abbrev=mqtt.
